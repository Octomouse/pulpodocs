## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](https://github.com/koding/hackathon.submit/raw/master/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

_Pulpo docs_ is a fast reader wich wich combines Spritz's incredible fast reading solution, with audio, emulating radio ads legal disclaimers. This allows you to fast-read legal documents in just a few minutes. Well, technically it allows you to fast-read anything, but let's stay on the hackathon's topic :)
I came up with this idea listening to radio ads. A fast speaking voice reading legal disclaimers works great for traditional radio, why not try the same with websites.websites
Pulpo docs addresses the "fine-print" problem by giving the content providers, and the users, a tool to read it and understanding it way faster than the traditional way.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the app in action, it's not visualy outstanding because i totally suck at ui :p but i think it is a creative and good solution.
